This repository holds the python files used in the research that contributed to Kaitlyn Rakestraw's MIT Supply Chain Management 2023 Capstone "Predicting Food Bank Demand: A Socioeconomic Analysis and Forecasting Model Investigation".

##Summary: 
This research evaluated the demand for food bank services from the Mid-Ohio Food Collective
(MOFC), highlighting how demand varied based on the socioeconomic vulnerability of counties. A framework was
created to cluster counties as "more vulnerable" or "less vulnerable", and forecasting models were tested on
demand data from each cluster. It was discovered that a naive forecasting model effectively predicted demand for
the more vulnerable regions, but an exponential smoothing model with level and trend components significantly
improved forecast accuracy for the less vulnerable regions. The insights from this study are applicable to all
United States counties, providing a valuable tool for food banks across the country to enhance their demand
forecast accuracy.
